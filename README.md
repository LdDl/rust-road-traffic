## About

Vehicle detection/tracking and speed estimation via next instruments:
1. Rust programming language - https://www.rust-lang.org/
2. OpenCV bindings - https://github.com/twistedfall/opencv-rust#rust-opencv-bindings. I'm using OpenCV 4.7.0 + v0.66.0 for bindings
3. Linear algebra - https://github.com/dimforge/nalgebra
4. Traditional YOLO v3 / v4 / v7 via OpenCV's DNN module - https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02767 / https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10934 / https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02696
5. YOLO v8 via ONNX + OpenCV's DNN module - https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics
5. actix-web for web part - https://actix.rs/

Notice:

UI is developed in seprate repository: https://github.com/LdDl/rust-road-traffic-ui. Therefore there is '[static_old](src/lib/rest_api/static_old/)' for just legacy and history + [static](src/lib/rest_api/static/)' for new one.

## Installation and usage
1. You need installed Rust compiler obviously. Follow instruction of official site: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

2. You need installed OpenCV and its contributors modules. I'm using OpenCV 4.7.0. I'd highly recommend to use OpenCV with CUDA. Here is [Makefile](Makefile) adopted from [this one](https://github.com/hybridgroup/gocv/blob/release/Makefile) if you want build it from sources (it's targeted for Linux user obviously).
    ```shell
    sudo make install_cuda
    ```

    __Be aware: OpenCV < 4.7.0 probably wont work with YOLOv8 (even with ONNX opset12) if you need those.__

3. OpenCV's bindings have already meant as dependencies in [Cargo.toml](Cargo.toml)

4. Clone the repo
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/LdDl/rust-road-traffic.git
    ```
    Well, actually I provide yolov4-tiny configuration and weights file from [official repository](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet) (authors of YOLOv4), but you are free to use yours.
    I provide video file as sample also.
    
5. Ð¡hange parameters for this utility by using template of [configuration file](data/conf.toml). There is detailed explanation of each parameter.

6. Download weights and configuration files (optional)

    - YOLO v4 tiny - [yolov4-tiny-vehicles-rect_best.weights](https://github.com/LdDl/yolo_vehicles/releases/download/v0.0.1/yolov4-tiny-vehicles-rect_best.weights) + [yolov4-tiny-vehicles-rect.cfg](https://github.com/LdDl/yolo_vehicles/releases/download/v0.0.1/yolov4-tiny-vehicles-rect.cfg). It has been trained on filtered COCO dataset; classes are: "car", "motorbike", "bus", "train", "truck"

    - YOLO v3 tiny - [tinyv3-vehicles_best.weights](https://github.com/LdDl/yolo_vehicles/releases/download/v0.0.1/tinyv3-vehicles_best.weights) + [tinyv3-vehicles.cfg](https://github.com/LdDl/yolo_vehicles/releases/download/v0.0.1/tinyv3-vehicles.cfg). It has been trained on AIC HCMC 2020 challenge data; classes are: "car", "motorbike", "bus", "truck". More information here: https://github.com/LdDl/yolo_vehicles . I like it more personally.

7. Run
    ```shell
    cargo run path-to-toml-file
    ```
    If you want to use some Rust's optimizations then call build and run
    ```shell
    cargo build --release && ./target/release/rust-road-traffic path-to-toml-file
    ```
    If you want both optimized in term of perfomance and stripped executable binary (thanks to https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/3483)
    ```shell
    export RUSTFLAGS='-C link-arg=-s' && cargo build --release && ./target/release/rust-road-traffic path-to-toml-file
    ```
    If you want to do some REST calls you can do following (based on *rest_api* field in TOML configuration files)
    ```bash
    # Get polygons (GeoJSON) in which road traffic monitoring is requested
    curl -XGET 'http://localhost:42001/api/polygons/geojson'
    # Get statistics info for each polygon and each vehicle type in that polygon
    curl -XGET 'http://localhost:42001/api/stats/all'
    ```

    If you enabled MJPEG streaming and you want to adjust parameters for velocity estimation you could open http://localhost:42001/ in your browser and adjust polygons as you need (this UI still needs to be debugged and polished):
